Okay, this is a well-defined PRD for an interesting SaaS product. Based on the requirements, the focus on AWS hosting, and the desire for a simple yet robust stack that accommodates future growth, here's a proposed technology stack:

**Guiding Principles for Selection:**

1.  **Leverage AWS Managed Services:** Minimize operational overhead, benefit from AWS scalability, security, and reliability features built-in.
2.  **Serverless-First (where practical):** Reduces infrastructure management, scales automatically (often cost-effectively for variable workloads), aligns well with event-driven patterns needed for AI tasks.
3.  **Proven Technologies:** Choose mature frameworks and services with strong community support and documentation.
4.  **Cohesive Ecosystem:** Prefer technologies that integrate well together, particularly within the AWS ecosystem.
5.  **Simplicity for MVP, Scalability for Future:** Start with straightforward implementations but ensure the underlying services can handle growth.

## Proposed Technology Stack

Here's a breakdown by the architectural planes and supporting components:

**1. Application Plane (Frontend - User Facing)**

*   **Framework/Library:** **React** (with **Vite** for build tooling, as mentioned in NFR-MAINT-01).
    *   *Rationale:* Highly popular, large ecosystem, component-based architecture suits complex UIs. Vite offers excellent development experience and fast builds.
*   **UI Components:** **AWS Amplify UI Components** or a component library like **MUI (Material UI)** / **Chakra UI**.
    *   *Rationale:* Amplify UI integrates seamlessly with Amplify Authentication and other AWS services. MUI/Chakra offer comprehensive, themeable components for building interfaces quickly. Choose one for consistency.
*   **State Management:** **React Context API** (for simpler state) + **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** (for more complex global state).
    *   *Rationale:* Start simple with Context, introduce a more robust library like Zustand (simpler) or Redux Toolkit (more structured) as needed for managing complex application state (tasks, dashboard data, user settings).
*   **Routing:** **React Router**.
    *   *Rationale:* Standard routing solution for React applications.
*   **Hosting:** **AWS Amplify Hosting**.
    *   *Rationale:* Simplifies CI/CD, deployment, hosting, CDN, custom domains, and feature branch deployments directly from Git. Tightly integrated with the Amplify ecosystem. *Alternative:* S3 + CloudFront (more manual setup).

**2. Application Plane (Backend - API & Logic)**

*   **Language/Framework:** **Python** with **FastAPI**.
    *   *Rationale:* Python has a mature ecosystem, especially strong for AI/ML integrations. FastAPI is modern, high-performance, provides automatic data validation (via Pydantic) and OpenAPI documentation, making API development efficient and robust. Its async capabilities are well-suited for I/O-bound tasks. *Alternative:* Node.js (TypeScript) with Express or NestJS is also a strong contender, especially if the team has stronger JavaScript expertise.
*   **Compute:** **AWS Lambda**.
    *   *Rationale:* Serverless compute. Pay-per-use, automatic scaling, integrates seamlessly with API Gateway and other AWS services. Ideal for event-driven API endpoints.
*   **API Layer:** **Amazon API Gateway** (HTTP API or REST API).
    *   *Rationale:* Managed service to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at scale. Integrates directly with Lambda for request routing and authorization. HTTP APIs are generally simpler and cheaper; REST APIs offer more features if needed later.
*   **Authentication Integration:** Use **AWS Amplify Libraries** (backend) or directly interact with **Amazon Cognito** via AWS SDK.
    *   *Rationale:* Securely verify user tokens passed from the frontend via API Gateway authorizers.

**3. Database**

*   **Primary Datastore:** **Amazon DynamoDB**.
    *   *Rationale:* Fully managed NoSQL database. Excellent scalability, performance, serverless model. NFR-SEC-04 explicitly requires tenant isolation, which is naturally implemented using the Tenant ID as part of the Partition Key in DynamoDB. Handles structured and semi-structured data well (user info, tasks, plan data, logs).
*   **Vector Store (for RAG):** **Amazon OpenSearch Serverless (Vector Engine)**.
    *   *Rationale:* Managed vector database capability within the AWS ecosystem. Needed for `REQ-AI-CAP-07` (RAG). Scales automatically and avoids managing separate vector DB infrastructure. *Alternative:* RDS PostgreSQL with `pgvector` (requires managing RDS), or third-party like Pinecone (adds external dependency).

**4. Generative AI Plane**

*   **LLM Access:** **Amazon Bedrock**.
    *   *Rationale:* Managed service providing access to various foundation models (Anthropic Claude, AI21, Cohere, Meta Llama, Amazon Titan) via a single API. Aligns with `REQ-AI-CAP-08` and AWS focus. Avoids managing model infrastructure.
*   **Web Crawling/Scraping:** **Python workers** (using libraries like **Playwright** or **Puppeteer** via `pyppeteer`) running on **AWS Fargate**.
    *   *Rationale:* Fargate provides serverless container orchestration. It's suitable for running resource-intensive or longer-running tasks like web scraping with headless browsers (`REQ-AI-CAP-02`), which might exceed Lambda's limitations.
*   **Asynchronous Task Processing:**
    *   **Queueing:** **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)**.
        *   *Rationale:* Decouple frontend/API requests from long-running AI tasks (analysis, plan generation). Highly scalable and reliable. The API can place a message (e.g., "analyze site X") onto an SQS queue.
    *   **Orchestration:** **AWS Step Functions**.
        *   *Rationale:* Coordinate multi-step AI workflows (e.g., crawl -> analyze -> generate plan -> store results -> notify user - `REQ-AI-API-03`). Provides visualization, error handling, and state management for complex asynchronous processes. Can trigger Lambda functions, Fargate tasks, and Bedrock calls.
*   **AI Logic/Prompting:** Implemented within Python Lambda functions or Fargate tasks, interacting with Bedrock and OpenSearch.

**5. Control Plane (Admin Facing)**

*   **Interface:** Integrated within the main **React Frontend**, using **role-based access control (RBAC)**.
    *   *Rationale:* Simplest approach for MVP. Define an 'Admin' group in Cognito. Show/hide admin sections/features in the UI based on the user's group membership.
*   **Backend:** Utilize dedicated **FastAPI endpoints** on the same **AWS Lambda** function (or a separate one if preferred), protected by authorizers checking for Admin role.
    *   *Rationale:* Reuses the existing backend infrastructure.

**6. Supporting Infrastructure & Services**

*   **Authentication & Authorization:** **AWS Amplify (using Amazon Cognito)**.
    *   *Rationale:* Explicitly mentioned (`REQ-FE-AUTH-04`). Provides user sign-up, sign-in, password reset, user pooling, and identity federation. Manages user sessions. Can define user groups (e.g., 'Admin', 'BasicTier', 'PremiumTier') for authorization.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** **AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)** using **TypeScript** or **Python**.
    *   *Rationale:* Define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages. Excellent integration with AWS services. Enables repeatable deployments and environment management. *Alternative:* Terraform.
*   **CI/CD:** **AWS CodePipeline** / **AWS CodeBuild** / **AWS CodeDeploy**.
    *   *Rationale:* Native AWS CI/CD services for automating builds, tests, and deployments for frontend (via Amplify Hosting integration) and backend (Lambda, Fargate). Integrates with CodeCommit, GitHub, Bitbucket. *Alternative:* GitHub Actions, GitLab CI.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** **Amazon CloudWatch** (Logs, Metrics, Alarms), **AWS X-Ray** (Distributed Tracing).
    *   *Rationale:* Essential for observing application health, debugging issues, monitoring resource usage (`REQ-CP-MON-01`, `NFR-REL-01`), and providing audit trails (`REQ-CP-MON-04`, `NFR-SEC-05`).
*   **Email Service (for Password Reset, Notifications):** **Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)**.
    *   *Rationale:* Scalable and cost-effective email sending service for transactional emails.
