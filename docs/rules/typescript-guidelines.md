# Code Style and Patterns

## TypeScript Guidelines

*   Use strict typing; avoid using `any` where possible.
*   Follow SOLID principles in class and module design.
*   Write unit tests for all public methods and exported functions.
*   Document exported members (classes, functions, types, interfaces) using JSDoc comments.
