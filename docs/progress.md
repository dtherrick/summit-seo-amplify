## Notes

### Progress on Day 2 (Current)

- Initialized the Python/FastAPI backend project with the following structure:
  - Set up folder structure with API, core, db, models, services, and utils modules
  - Created basic models for users and tenants
  - Implemented DynamoDB client utilities
  - Added Cognito authentication utilities
  - Created API routes for users and tenants
  - Set up FastAPI application with CORS and API router
  - Added AWS Lambda integration using Mangum
  
- Set up the modern Python package management with uv:
  - Created virtual environment using uv
  - Installed dependencies with uv pip
  - Generated requirements.lock file for reproducible builds
  - Updated documentation to reflect uv usage

- Configured AWS Cognito User Pool:
  - Created a User Pool with secure password policies and email verification
  - Added custom attributes for tenant/business information and user roles
  - Created an App Client with proper OAuth and authentication flows
  - Set up Cognito domain for hosted UI
  - Configured environment variables for backend integration
  
- Next tasks:
  - Implement frontend authentication components
  - Connect frontend to backend API

### DynamoDB Table Creation (New Section)
- Successfully defined and deployed core DynamoDB tables (Users, Tenants) using AWS CDK.
  - Users table (`SummitSEOAmplify-Users`) includes a GSI on `cognito_id`.
  - Tenants table (`SummitSEOAmplify-Tenants`) includes a GSI on `owner_id`.
  - Both tables are configured with on-demand billing.

### Roadblocks

- None at the moment

### Cognito Configuration Details

- **User Pool ID**: us-east-1_amWoKMkcF
- **App Client ID**: 4s0peq2cv7vuuvq00frkrt13hb
- **Cognito Domain**: https://summit-seo-amplify-dev.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com
- **Custom Attributes**: 
  - tenant_id: Links users to their business/organization
  - subscription_tier: Tracks subscription level (free, basic, premium)
  - business_name: Name of the user's business
  - business_website: Primary website URL for SEO analysis
  - business_industry: Business industry for targeted recommendations
  - user_type: Defines user role (user, admin)

### Progress on Day 4 (Backend User Profile Integration)

- Implemented `PUT /users/me` endpoint for user profile updates (currently `full_name` only).
- Added comprehensive unit tests for the `PUT /users/me` endpoint, including input validation and error handling.
- Confirmed all backend tests for user profile functionality are passing.
- Reviewed and confirmed DynamoDB access patterns for user and tenant data in `backend/app/db/dynamodb.py`.
- Verified security of user profile endpoints (`GET /me`, `PUT /me`) using Cognito authentication.
- Next: Connect frontend to backend user profile APIs.

### Frontend Refactoring (Day 4.5)
- Successfully refactored the frontend codebase into a dedicated `frontend/` directory.
- All relevant configuration files (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `amplify.yml`, `.gitignore`, `tsconfig.node.json`) have been updated to reflect the new structure.
- Build processes and import paths within the frontend source have been adjusted.
- This provides a cleaner project structure for ongoing frontend development.
