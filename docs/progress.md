- [x] Update `.gitignore` to reflect new paths for `frontend/node_modules/`, `frontend/dist/`, etc.
- [x] Adjust `include` path in `tsconfig.node.json` to point to `frontend/vite.config.ts`.
- [x] Correct the import path for `amplify_outputs.json` in `frontend/src/main.tsx` to `../../amplify_outputs.json`.

### Day 4.6: Amplify Build Debugging (In Progress)
- Investigating Amplify build failure after frontend refactor.
- Initial error points to `npm ci` failing due to missing `package-lock.json`.
- Ensured `frontend/package-lock.json` is committed.
- Identified that `npm ci` in the `backend` build phase of `amplify.yml` (running at project root) is the likely cause.
- Modified `amplify.yml` to comment out the root `npm ci` command in the backend build phase.
- User confirmed backend is managed via CDK/GitHub Actions; entire `backend` build phase in `amplify.yml` commented out.
- Frontend build failing due to Node version mismatch (Amplify using 18.x, deps need 20/22+) and out-of-sync package-lock.json.
- Updated `amplify.yml` to use Node 20 via nvm in `preBuild` phase.
- Advised user to regenerate `frontend/package-lock.json` locally using Node 20 and commit.
- Changed `npm ci` to `npm install` in `amplify.yml` for the frontend build to potentially resolve package-lock.json sync issues.

### Day 4.7: API Gateway/Lambda Auth Debugging (Current)
- Investigated 401 Unauthorized error from API Gateway.
- Curl output and API Gateway logs indicated the 401 was returned by the Lambda integration, not API Gateway itself.
- Decoded JWT showed `token_use: "id"` and `aud` claim matching `COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID`.
- CloudWatch logs from Lambda showed "error verifying token: 'client_id'".
- Identified that `backend/app/utils/cognito.py` was incorrectly checking `claims['client_id']` instead of `claims['aud']` for ID tokens.
- Updated `backend/app/utils/cognito.py` to use `claims['aud']`.
- Advised user to confirm `COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID` environment variable in Lambda is set to `4s0peq2cv7vuuvq00frkrt13hb`.

### Day 4.8: FastAPI Response Validation Error (Current)
- After fixing auth, API Gateway returned 500 Internal Server Error.
- Lambda logs showed `fastapi.exceptions.ResponseValidationError` for `/api/v1/users/me`.
- Error indicated missing `id` and `tenant_id` fields in the response, compared to the `User` Pydantic model.
- The actual data from DynamoDB contained `user_id` instead of `id`, and `tenant_id` was missing entirely.
- Updated `backend/app/api/endpoints/users.py` in `read_users_me` to transform `user_id` to `id` in the response.
- User to investigate why `tenant_id` is missing from the DynamoDB user item and check the Cognito post-confirmation trigger.
- Confirmed via screenshot that `tenant_id` is missing from the specific user's DynamoDB item.
- Updated `backend/app/models/user.py` to make `tenant_id` Optional in `UserInDB` model as a short-term fix.
- Discussed long-term strategy for `tenant_id` assignment, Cognito post-confirmation trigger, and data backfill.

### Day 4.9: API Gateway CORS Troubleshooting (Resolved) ✅
- Investigated CORS preflight (OPTIONS) request failures from Amplify-hosted frontend (`https://main.d9e32iiq5ru07.amplifyapp.com`) to API Gateway.
- Error: "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."
- Reviewed API Gateway (HTTP API) configuration in `infrastructure/lib/infrastructure-stack.ts`.
- Identified potential mismatch in `allowOrigins`: CDK had a trailing slash (`https://main.d9e32iiq5ru07.amplifyapp.com/`) while browser error showed no trailing slash.
- Updated `corsPreflight.allowOrigins` in `infrastructure-stack.ts` to remove the trailing slash for the Amplify domain.
- Advised user to redeploy CDK stack and clear browser cache.
- User confirmed API is working after redeploying the CDK stack with the fix.

### Day 5: Initial Survey UI / Landing Page (In Progress)
- **Resolved Vite import error for `LandingPageContent`:** (This was an older item, keeping for context)
  - The error "Failed to resolve import '../components/marketing/LandingPageContent' from 'src/routes/index.tsx'" occurred because the component was not found at the specified path.
  - Created the directory `frontend/src/components/marketing/`.
  - Created a placeholder file `frontend/src/components/marketing/LandingPageContent.tsx`.
  - This allows the import in `frontend/src/routes/index.tsx` to resolve, enabling the initial page to load.
- **Configured Root Route for Landing Page:** ✅
  - Updated `frontend/src/routes/index.tsx` to use `LandingPage.tsx` from `frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` for the root path (`/`).
  - Ensured unauthenticated users are directed to the correct landing page.
- **Corrected `SurveyWizard.tsx` Component:** ✅
  - Resolved linter errors by correctly typing the `steps` array and placeholder step components.
- **Cleaned Global Styles:** ✅
  - Removed a global purple gradient background from `frontend/src/index.css` to allow component-specific backgrounds to take precedence.
- **Adjusted Survey Wizard Width:** ✅
  - Modified `frontend/src/components/onboarding/SurveyWizard.tsx` to increase the column spans for larger screen sizes (lg, xl, xxl), allowing the survey wizard to utilize more horizontal space and prevent step headers from being cut off.
- **Improved Survey Step Header Display:** ✅
  - Applied flexbox styling to the Ant Design `Steps` component in `frontend/src/components/onboarding/SurveyWizard.tsx` to ensure step headers are evenly spaced across the card.
  - Enabled text wrapping for step titles to prevent truncation of longer headers like 'Competitors & Content'.
- Next steps: Complete implementation of survey steps in `SurveyWizard.tsx`, including form validation and state management.

### Day 5.1: Python Test Error Resolution (Current)
- Resolved `ImportError: cannot import name 'get_dynamodb_table' from 'backend.app.db.dynamodb'` in Python tests.
- The error occurred because `backend/app/api/endpoints/onboarding.py` was trying to import a non-existent function `get_dynamodb_table`.
- Modified `backend/app/api/endpoints/onboarding.py` to directly import and use the existing `tenants_table` object from `backend.app/db/dynamodb.py`.
- Updated Pydantic V1 `.dict()` to V2 `.model_dump()` in `backend/app/api/endpoints/onboarding.py` for survey data serialization.

### Day 5.2: Frontend Survey Submission Errors (Current)
- Investigated CORS errors and 500 Internal Server Error when submitting the onboarding survey from the frontend.
- The initial CORS preflight errors from `http://127.0.0.1:5173` to `https://qi9k0zm7z8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` were addressed by the user by adjusting API Gateway CORS settings.
- The subsequent 500 Internal Server Error was traced to a double slash (`//`) in the constructed API request URL: `https://qi9k0zm7z8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api/v1//onboarding/survey`.
- This was caused by a trailing slash in the `endpoint` definition for `SummitSEOAmplifyAPI` in `amplify_outputs.json` combined with a leading slash in the `path` specified in `frontend/src/services/onboardingService.ts`.
- Resolved by removing the trailing slash from the `endpoint` in `amplify_outputs.json`.

### Day 5.3: Lambda Import Error Resolution (Current)
- Investigated `Runtime.ImportModuleError: Unable to import module 'app.main': No module named 'backend'` in Lambda logs.
- The error was caused by absolute imports (e.g., `from backend.app...`) in `backend/app/api/endpoints/onboarding.py`.
- Other modules within the `app` directory were using relative imports.
- Changed the imports in `backend/app/api/endpoints/onboarding.py` to be relative (e.g., `from ...utils.security...`) to align with the project structure and Lambda's Python path expectations.

- Confirmed all backend tests for user profile functionality are passing.
- Reviewed and confirmed DynamoDB access patterns for user and tenant data in `backend/app/db/dynamodb.py`.
- Verified security of user profile endpoints (`GET /me`, `PUT /me`) using Cognito authentication.
- Next: Connect frontend to backend user profile APIs.

### Frontend Refactoring (Day 4.5)
- Successfully refactored the frontend codebase into a dedicated `frontend/` directory.
- All relevant configuration files (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `amplify.yml`, `.gitignore`, `tsconfig.node.json`) have been updated to reflect the new structure.
- Build processes and import paths within the frontend source have been adjusted.
- This provides a cleaner project structure for ongoing frontend development.

- Changed `npm ci` to `npm install` in `amplify.yml` for the frontend build to potentially resolve package-lock.json sync issues.
- Addressed `npm run build` failures:
  - Created `frontend/src/amplify-outputs.d.ts` to fix `Cannot find module '../../amplify_outputs.json'` in `main.tsx`.
  - Corrected type assertions and handling for API response in `frontend/src/UserProfile.tsx` to resolve TypeScript errors (TS2345, TS18047, TS2339).

- Investigating `InvalidApiName` error despite matching API name in `UserProfile.tsx` and `amplify_outputs.json`.
  - Cleaned up placeholder comments in `UserProfile.tsx`.
- Identified that `Amplify.configure` was not registering the API configuration from `amplify_outputs.json`.
  - Modified `
